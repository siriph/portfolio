 <p>
<strong> Duration:</strong> September 2018 - October 2018 
</p>

<p>
 <strong> Objective:</strong> Design and program a creative app on MIT App Inventor 
 for a smartphone or tablet 
 </p>


We developed an app that has the capabilities of sending messages (text, emojis, or
emoticons) or media (pictures or videos). 
Select the type of message or take the picture you want to send, 
and it automatically redirects you to Gmail, where you can send the message/video
to any recipient. Our app also allows the user to take a video, save it, and view
it on the app at a later time. <br></br>

<a href="designnotebook.pdf" target="_blank"> The MIT App Inventor Documentation has
more information about our app. </a>

I focused on programming the app and gained a lot of knowledge on the coding aspect of apps and I especially 
strengthened my skills on global variables and troubleshooting. One of our difficult
tasks that we overcame was incorporating the video sending component on our app, but 
after days of research and work, we realized that MIT App Inventor does not have the
capabilities of sending video files (but our app can save the video though) so we put
a feature in substitute of sending videos.<br></br>

I learned the importance of saving our drafts and writing comments because we were 
sometimes lost in our code and even accidentally 
deleted some code, which we were able to get back because of our continuous saving.
The comments we got from our peers were very helpful because it gave us new ideas and 
improvements we can put in our app and new perspectives were very insightful. I especially
learned how to work ahead of problems and manage to put in our 100% effort, despite the
fact that we lost about four days due to technical difficulties because MIT App Inventor
could no longer support our original app, the “Where’s My Car” (GPS) app, but these hardships 
are part of our app development process! I feel like I learned a lot about coding 
and many important qualities, including working together on a team and making
and following a timeline.
