                            <h3>Our aim is to create free and clean energy through your cars</h3>
                            <p>Drawing from the idea of possible renewable energy that could be gained from the wind all    
                            around us in our everyday lives, we decided to venture into building a portable wind turbine 
                            that could be placed on a car or other vehicles. The idea would be to attach a wind turbine onto 
                            a car, or other vehicle, which while operating at speeds of a range from 0-45 mph will generate
                            electricity to be stored in an isolated battery. What makes this device even more unique is that 
                            when going over the recommended threshold of 45 mph, the device will automatically retract the 
                            wind turbine such that it does not break from the stress from the air. Once the car is at a 
                            constant speed within the threshold limits, the user will have the option to extend the the 
                            wind turbine back into its operating position. Retrawind Batteryâ€™s goal is to develop a functional
                            proof of concept that provides an affordable and environmentally-friendly solution to pollution from 
                            disposed batteries. The device will collect and store energy in a rechargeable battery by converting 
                            the wind collected from a wind turbine attached to a car. This energy storage can be used for a wide 
                            spectrum of purposes, whether it is charging a phone or helping a broken car restart.
