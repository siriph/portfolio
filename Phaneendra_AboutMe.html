Hi there! I am a junior in the Engineering & Design Academy at Dublin High School.
Leading and engaging in hands-on engineering projects at my academy has paved my 
way to learn and explore a variety of concepts in science and technology. I see 
myself as a creative person. Unlike many professions, coding has its own originality,
where you create programs from scratch, using unique algorithms. I feel empowered
when I make something come to life on my computer. The feeling I get when I 
successfully code a program is indescribable. The long hours working on the
program is finally worth the time spent. It gives me a sense of accomplishment. 
My love for programming and coding first started at the age of ten, when I
received a robotics set for Christmas. I built the robot and controlled the 
features and functionalities of it, by using an online programming application.
I want to continue my education in the field of computer science. I envision 
myself graduating from a college with degrees in computer science and business.
I aspire to do the M.E.T. (Management, Entrepreneurship, Technology) program 
in the University of Berkeley.

 The Engineering and Design Academy has helped me nurture my knowledge in 
 computer science and given me the confidence to explore these skills further
 down the career line. The academy gave me an opportunity to attend Python coding
 workshops at University of California Berkeley that roused my eagerness to 
 explore more coding languages, including HTML, CSS, and Java, in the future.

 
You will either find me working in my office or volunteering at a local hospital.
I am the founder of You and I Give, an organization where we raise funds for local hospitals. 
Our current project is to raise $1000 for terminally ill children at George 
Mark Children's House. This amount will be used to provide financial support 
to cover patients' costs of hydrotherapy sessions, bereavement for families, 
and medications/medical devices. Apart from coding and programming, my life 
revolves around Bharatanatyam (an Indian classical dance) and composing my own
guitar songs. I have been dancing since the age of six and have had the privilege 
to perform at many public venues, including on NBC TV. 


Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. Feel free to explore 
the rest of my portfolio.
