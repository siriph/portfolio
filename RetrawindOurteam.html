                                <p>In this Space Invaders App Inventor Project, our group's objective was to initially program a basic Space Invaders
                                   game and then further develop the game by adding unique features. In this project, I was primarily the programmer 
                                   on the software for the game while my partner, Grace Liu, aided in the documentation of the project. Throughout the 
                                   project, my partner and I kept a very consistent update log of the code over email to adjust to the inability of the 
                                   software for multiple devices to edit at the same time. We also kept each other accountable for the work that was 
                                   completed by filling in the daily log with all the changes and work that was done each day. Overall, I learned many 
                                   new interactions with the code and how to adapt to challenges with game breaking issues, such as clashing variables 
                                   in the code that made the game unplayable. We managed to fix these issues by taking suggestions from peers and doing 
                                   more research on the components within the code that we were manipulating.

                                <p>For this idea, I had done the main designing of our prototype and tried to figure out the best way to
                                make this idea work. I had build the prototype that we had done, building the prototype was hard due to 
                                the amount of resources needed to build to build it but we had been able to do it. After building the prototype
