                    <p>We had discovered that in our day to day lives we had experianced a lot of traffic
                    and through a lot of research we had found that a lot of fuel and energy had been wasted in
                    traffic. This energy is very precious and also cost us money everyday. We had decided to solve
                    this problem by creating the ReTraWind Battery, this battery runs on the wind energy produced 
                    by a turbine everyday when your in traffic. Pollution was a big issue for us and we wanted to be 
                    able to do our part inorder to make our Earth much cleaner. Many countries which have power cutouts
                    everyday will be able to use this stored energy from their cars for essential needs.<br><br>
                    The turbine design features four turbine propellors and 2v and 12v motor configurations which gives ample power in
                    emergencies. The main standout feature of this design is that it able to flip up and down thereby not
                    affecting the drag coefficent in a car. When your car is going 45mph or slower the wind turbine will automatically flip 
                    outwards to generate electricity, then when your car goes above 45 mph then it will automatically flip down so there won't 
                    be a lot of drag on the propellor so it does not fall apart due to immense speeed.<br><br>This device was able to generate up
                    to 12v on a regular day which is more than enough to be able to power a battery and after long road trips. A person would have 
                    a lot of energy stored in the battery for other use. We plan to extend ths idea further by implementing this on to the car battery
                    of an electric car or hybrid car to increase range in emergencies. Our aim is to encourage clean and free energy that helps
                    people in emergencies such as low range or power shortages. The energy stored in these batteries can also be sold to the electrcity 
                    plants so we don't burn any more fossil fuels.
